# Ubuntu Optimization: Updating, Swap, and Disabling Unnecessary Services

---

## 🛠 Updating Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo apt autoremove
```

---

## 📋 Check Current Swap Usage

```bash
sudo swapon --show
```

---

## 🧊 Create Swap File

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
# OR if fallocate is unsupported:
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=2048
```

---

## 🔒 Set Permissions

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
```

---

## 🔧 Configure Swap

```bash
sudo mkswap /swapfile
```

---

## 🚀 Activate Swap

```bash
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

---

## 🔄 Make Swap Permanent

```bash
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

---

## 📝 Adjust Swappiness (Optional)

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```

Add or modify:

```
vm.swappiness=10
```

Apply:

```bash
sudo sysctl --system
```

---

## 📊 Monitor Swap Usage

```bash
htop
free -h
```

---

## 🔌 Identify Running Services

```bash
systemctl
service --status-all
chkconfig --list
```

---

## 🔍 Review Services to Stop or Disable

---

## 📴 Disable & Stop Services (Systemd)

Disable at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable <service-name>
```

Stop immediately:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop <service-name>
```

---

## 📴 Disable & Stop Services (SysVinit)

Disable at boot:

```bash
sudo update-rc.d -f <service-name> remove
```

Stop immediately:

```bash
sudo service <service-name> stop
```

---

## 🔁 Verify Services are Stopped

```bash
systemctl status <service-name>
service <service-name> status
```

---

## 📋 Review Impact

✅ Make sure no critical services are stopped.

---

## 🔄 Optional: Reboot

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

## 📈 Monitor Performance

✅ Check CPU, memory, and disk usage after changes:

```bash
htop
free -h
df -h
```

---

## 🔗 Best Practices

* Back up `/etc/fstab` before editing.
* Monitor available disk space before creating swap.
* Be cautious with SSDs — swap can wear them over time.
* On cloud VMs, confirm if swap is already provisioned.
* Only disable services you fully understand.

---

### Additional important points:

✅ Before creating swap, check if you already have enough physical RAM and swap — overusing swap on SSD can wear it.
✅ Always back up `/etc/fstab` before editing it:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
```

✅ For swap, consider using `dd` instead of `fallocate` on some filesystems (like XFS, Btrfs) that don’t fully support `fallocate`.
✅ Monitor disk space before allocating swap — don’t fill your root partition completely.
✅ On cloud VMs, confirm whether the provider already provisions swap.
✅ For disabling services: disable only what you fully understand; disabling critical services can make your system unbootable.
